// Refunded	- Transaction has been refunded to user. Do not provide service.
// Expired	- User have not made the payment, Do not provide the service.
// User canceled	User have canceled the payment, Do not provide the service.

// Only the status with Completed must be treated as success.
// Status Canceled , Expired , Failed must be treated as failed.

// For status other than these, hold the transaction and contact KHALTI team.
